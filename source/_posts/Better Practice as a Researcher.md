- Any academic ideas, no matter how small, must be done as soon as possible. Don't hesitate. The sooner, the better. The more small ideas are done, the easier it is to have high-quality ideas.
- When I can't think of novel research points, It generally means I don't read enough materials. From my perspective, if I look through 100 works of literature in a small direction in a row and summarize them in time, I am more likely to find out new ideas.
- It is essential to be good at observing and learning from others. While doing our work, we pay more attention to the people around us. Find out which people are outstanding, what impressive points we could learn, or what pits we can avoid. It is very disadvantageous to close the mind. 
- Whenever encountering opportunities, we must be courageous to seize them independently. Please don't wait for the supervisor to catch it for us, since it's our obligation. The more active we are, the higher our chance to make a difference.
