## Introduction

Reinforcement Learning is a mechanism extracted from the intelligence of species in nature, which could be an important part of the eventual objective of creating consciousness from materials.

The agent and the environment are the key characters of RL. The environment is the setting in which the agent operates and interacts. The agent decides what action to take after seeing a (potentially incomplete) observation of the condition of the world at each stage of the interaction. The environment can change on its own or as a result of the agent's actions. The agent also picks up a reward signal from its surroundings, which is a numeric indicator of how good or awful the status of the world is right now. The agent's objective is to maximize its total reward, or return. Methods of reinforcement learning allow the agent to pick up behaviors that will help it accomplish its objective.Â
